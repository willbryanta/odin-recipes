    <h1>Hawaiin Pizza</h1>

    <h2> Description</h2>
    <p>Hawaiian pizza is underrated. Combining pineapple, cheese, and ham, Hawaiian pizza is sweet, salty,
         and cheesy all in 1 bite. It's just the BEST pizza variety! We're using my homemade pizza crust 
         and adding bacon on top. Bacon isn't a traditional Hawaiian pizza topping, but everything goes with bacon… <em>right?</em></p>
    <p>It's the best homemade pizza crust. I always use Red Star Platinum in my pizza dough because I have the best results.
        The Platinum line is fantastic; its careful formula strengthens your dough and makes making working with yeast simple.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Yeast</li>
        <li>Pineapple</li>
        <li>Olives</li>
        <li>Tomato Sauce</li>
        <li>Oregano</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Dough: Prepare pizza dough through step 3. If using store-bought frozen pizza dough, make sure it's thawed. </li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 475°F (246°C). Allow it to heat for at least 15-20 minutes as you shape the pizza in the next step. If using a pizza stone, place it in the oven to preheat as well. Lightly grease a large baking sheet or pizza pan with 1/2 Tablespoon of olive oil. 
            Sprinkle lightly with cornmeal, which gives the crust extra crunch and flavor.</li>
        <li>Shape the dough: When the homemade dough is ready, punch it down to release any air bubbles. Divide the dough in half and freeze half the dough for another time—see freezing instructions in the pizza dough recipe.
            On a lightly floured work surface using lightly floured hands or rolling pin, gently flatten the dough into a disc. Place on prepared pan and, using lightly floured hands, stretch and flatten the disc into a
            12-inch circle, about 1/2-inch thick. If the dough keeps shrinking back as you try to stretch it, stop what you're doing, cover it lightly and let it rest for 5-10 minutes, then try again.</li>
        <li>Top & bake the pizza: Using your fingers, push dents into the surface of the dough to prevent bubbling. Brush remaining olive oil all over the dough. Top the dough evenly with pizza sauce, then add the cheese, ham, pineapple, and bacon.</li>
        <li>Bake for 14-15 minutes or until the crust is golden brown. Remove from the oven.</li>
        <li>Slice hot pizza and serve immediately. Cover leftover pizza tightly and store in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. Freezing and reheating instructions below.</li>
